## Introduction

The dsmSearch R pacakge can currently be installed via github.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("land-info-lab/dsmSearch", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Baesd on the TNMAccess API, LiDAR search facilitate the retrieval and exploration of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data (from USGS) within a specified bounding box (bbox). This function enables users to search for LiDAR data, preview available graphics, and optionally download LiDAR data files for further viewscape analysis. Current dataset of USGS covers the most area in the US: https://apps.nationalmap.gov/lidar-explorer/#/ 

```{r}
# search for lidar data information using bbox
search_result <- dsmSearch::lidar_search(bbox = c(-83.742282,42.273389,-83.733442,42.278724), preview = TRUE)
```

From viewshed analysis, the visible area of a viewpoint is presented by visible points. There are several viewshed metrics such as can be calculated based on the visible points. For further information on these metrics and the rest of the functions available in this package please refer to the [package website](https://billbillbilly.github.io/viewscape/). For more information and examples of the functions check out the [package vignette](needs to be created).

## Issues and bugs

This package may take a long time to run if using spatially large or high resolution digital elevation models. 

If you discover a bug not associated with connection to the API that is not already a [reported issue](https://github.com/billbillbilly/viewscape/issues), please [open a new issue](https://github.com/billbillbilly/viewscape/issues/new) providing a reproducible example.
